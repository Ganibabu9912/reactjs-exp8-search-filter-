### Description
The screenshot shows the **Search Filter Example** React + Vite app.  
Here, the user typed `"Mah"` in the input box, and the list dynamically filtered the names to display **"Mahesh"**.  
This demonstrates how the search filter works in real time, updating results instantly as the user types.
